# Group Project - Group 23
Jan - May 2016
#####Instructions
To work on the code type this into the console:

    git clone https://github.com/NevilleKing/GroupProject
Then use `git checkout` to switch to the `develop` branch:

    git checkout develop
You will need to create a new branch from `develop` to implement a new feature. Type:

    git checkout -b INSERT-BRANCH-NAME
Use `git pull` to pull changes from GitHub.

`git status` allows you to see the status of the repo (i.e. uncomitted files).

When you want to save the files in the repo use:

    git add .
    git commit -m "COMMIT-MSG-HERE"

Use `git push` to push local changes to GitHub.

Once you have a stable version and want to merge back into `develop` create a pull request on GitHub, with your branch as the compare and `develop` as the base branch.
